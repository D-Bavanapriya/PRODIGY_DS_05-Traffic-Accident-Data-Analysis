# Traffic Accident Data Analysis
This repository is focused on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to road traffic accidents. The project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to the dataset and uses data visualization to highlight key findings. The goal is to understand the factors contributing to traffic accidents and gain insights into how to mitigate them.

# Files
Traffic Accident Data Analysis.ipynb: A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that covers the end-to-end workflow for analyzing traffic accident data. It includes data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and identifying trends that could inform road safety measures.

RTA Dataset.csv: The dataset containing records of road traffic accidents. The dataset includes various features such as the time, location, weather conditions, and severity of accidents, which are critical for analysis.

# Key Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: Detected and addressed missing or null values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
Data Cleaning: Standardized column names, removed unnecessary data points, and corrected inconsistencies.
Data Types: Ensured that the correct data types were used for each feature (e.g., converting categorical variables to numerical labels if needed).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Computed basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand the data distribution.
Data Distribution: Visualized the distribution of key features such as accident severity, location, and time using histograms, box plots, and bar charts.
Correlation Analysis: Used a correlation matrix and heatmaps to analyze relationships between features such as weather conditions, time of day, and accident severity.
3. Data Visualization
Accident Severity: Visualized the frequency and distribution of accidents based on severity levels (minor, major, fatal).
Location Analysis: Mapped accidents to specific locations or regions to identify accident hotspots.
Time-based Trends: Analyzed the frequency of accidents during different times of the day, days of the week, and months of the year to identify peak accident periods.
Weather Conditions: Explored the relationship between weather conditions (rain, fog, etc.) and accident severity.
4. Identifying Key Patterns
Accident Hotspots: Identified areas with the highest number of accidents and explored possible contributing factors.
High-Risk Time Periods: Found that certain time frames (e.g., rush hours) are more prone to accidents and analyzed the possible causes.
Impact of Weather: Highlighted how adverse weather conditions such as rain or fog increase the likelihood of severe accidents.
5. Recommendations for Road Safety
Preventive Measures: Based on the insights gathered, proposed preventive measures such as improving infrastructure in accident-prone areas, enforcing stricter traffic regulations during peak hours, and increasing public awareness about safe driving in poor weather conditions.
# Technologies Used
